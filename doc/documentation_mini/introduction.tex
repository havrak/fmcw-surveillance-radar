While two axis rotary platforms are fairly common in  machining they are often costly and their operational parmaters are rarely suitable for radar applications.
Aside form laborary indexing tables, which are rather slow, most platforms aren't designed with communication interface that would facilitate such usecase.
Timely execution of movements is not guaranteed and most solutions don't support frequent uplink about current position.

Following thesis is focused on designing and building a two axis rotary platform with such usecase in mind.
This mainly entails very timely and deterministic movement of the steppers in order for the radar processing to be able to correctly counteract movement in post processing.
However other functionality is also needed in order to limit the burder on the user.


First chapter of the thesiss outlines basic design requirements for the plaform accoding to radar paramters.
Follow on focuses on Hardware side of the project be it electronic parts used or mechanical design.
Last chapter is dedicated to the software handling control of the platform.
